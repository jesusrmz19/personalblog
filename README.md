# Personal Blog

This is the code of my personal blog.

I just learned how to use [`NextJS`](https://nextjs.org/), so I decided to create this page with it.

## Uses:

- [`fontawesome-for-react`](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react)
- [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)
- [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)
- [`remark-html`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html)
- [`remark-highlight.js`](https://github.com/ben-eb/remark-highlight.js)
